Step 1:
The user will be prompted three times to enter each individual value for the room's measurements. 
First will ask for length, Second will ask for width and Third will ask for height.

As mentioned in the Build Specifications, the user is expected to enter valid numerical values, which can include decimal values. (Therefore doubles must be used.)

All three values will be stored into their own variables.

Step 2:
The program will take the three variables, and declare three new variables with values calculated via the appropriate arithmetic expressions. Area is calculated by multiplying length and width, Perimeter by the sum of 2*length and 2*width, and volume by multiplying area with height.

As mentioned in the Build Specifications, the rooms are expected to be perfect rectangles. No other variants of area, perimeter or volume formulas are necessary.

Step 3:
Once the calculations are made and the values are assigned, the program will then display the values with their appropriate tag. Shortly afterwards, the program will prompt the user if they would like to continue using the program. Entering "y" will loop back to the initial three prompts, while entering "n" (or anything other than "y") will end the loop and the program will terminate.
